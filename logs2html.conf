#			  Resulting name will  be "logs-page-prefixYYmmdd_pgN.html".
#			  For example if we set "logs-page-prefix" to "mychan", then the
#			  first page of logfile for the 1st january 2009 will look
#			  like "mychan20090101_pg1.html"
#    logs-page-title	- your logs page title for this channel (will be shown
#			  as the caption of the web page in your browser)
